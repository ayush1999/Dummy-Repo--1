# Dummy-Repo--1

Trying and testing my codes in Jupyter.
(And SWIG):

P.S : A great thing i discovered about SWIG after being pointed out by a senior : There is no need to make an interface for each and every function, but only the main functions. Smaller functions (which are never called directly) donot need this interface. :)
